# Redirect the root app-of-apps to the users local git repo (usually a fork)
# if that repo is a simple clone this replacement is a noop
# if that repo is a fork, this repo will updated to the forked repo

# This allows any component to be replaced via gitops via a kustomize development directory
# That directory needs to be modified in the users fork when replacing any components in their cluster
# This will minimize the chance of error in pull requests to upstream which may accidentally include
# references to the forked repo.
# note, if accidental merges are accepted in the development directory, they will not affect staging.
